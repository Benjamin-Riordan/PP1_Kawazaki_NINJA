## UserExperience

In this section, We are going to provide insights into my UX process, mainly focusing on who this web application is built for, what they intent to achieve and how they can best utilise this web application to fulfil their needs.

According to Caglar Araz from UX Collective, User Experience (UX) is "User experience refers to the singular and accumulated experiences that occur for users as a consequence of them interacting with an object in a given context."

The planning and development of this project is divided into 5 planes:

1. The Strategy Plane
2. The Scope Plane
3. The Structure Plane
4. The Skeleton Plane
5. The Surface Plane

## **Strategy Plane**

### Creator Goals

-   to create an interactive web application that is fully responsive on desktop to smaller devices such as mobile.

-   to create a website with interface design, presenting a logical structure allowing users to easily navigate.

-   to build a site that will enable any motorbike rider no matter what skill level to fall in love with a ninja of thier choice

### User Stories

-   As a first-time user, I would like the purpose of the website to be clear and straight forward.

-   As a first-time user, I would like to be able to navigate to desired sections on the site without having to search and scroll.

-   As a first-time user, I would like to easily access resources and guidance on buying the nija i want or learnign about the ninja i likw
